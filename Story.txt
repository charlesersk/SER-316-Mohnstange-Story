I was in Berlin at the Flughafen, drinking a local hefeweizen called "Das Eltz" when I saw Rammstein walking through. 
They airport bar isn't like the Ratskellers I had recently visited, everything is overpriced, including the beer. Rammstien sat down the airport bar, just two tables away, they looked hung over and ordered enough Bratwurst to feed all of Belgium and the beer in the spot, 
und da brach die HÃ¶lle los.
