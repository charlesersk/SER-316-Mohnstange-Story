I was in Berlin at the Flughafen, drinking a local hefeweizen called "Das Eltz" when I saw Rammstein walking through. 
They airport bar isn't like the Ratskellers I had recently visited, everything is overpriced, including the beer. Rammstien sat down the airport bar, just two tables away, they looked hung over and ordered enough Bratwurst to feed all of Belgium and the beer in the spot, 
und da brach die HÃ¶lle los. Brot and Bratwurst all flew through the air as everyone drank free beer. Who am I to stop the mosh pit or forgo wettbewerbsfaehig drinking? Besides there was a pretty girl in a Dirndel who had caught my eye. She told me she worked in Baeckerei making Gebaeck. I thought no wonder she smelled of Apfelkuchen. The world started to spin, and I found myself in a BMW cruising down Hauptstrasse. I missed my flight, which wasn't too bad, but my luggage went on ahead. So there I was nearly blackout wearing someone else's Lederhose dancing in someone's Schloss. It was quite the night, truly a riot. The pictures I have tell an outsanding tale. And that's why I didn't finish the assignment.
